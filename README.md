- **Lab10** - ASP.NET Core MVC app for Unit 8 (Securing ASP.NET Core Application): ASP.NET Core Identity with EF Core and SQL Server, custom `AppUser`, user registration (username, email, password, confirm password), login/logout, and `[Authorize]` secured resources.

## Database setup

Labs that use SQL Server (`SAUGAT\SQLEXPRESS`) create their database as follows:

| Lab | Database | How it is created |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Lab7.1 | `Company` | Run `SQLSetup.sql` in SSMS (see `Lab7\Lab7.1\README.md`) |
| Lab7.2 | `EmployeeDB` | Run `SQLSetup.sql` in SSMS (see `Lab7\Lab7.2\README.md`) |
| Lab8.1 | `StudentDB` | EF Core `EnsureCreated()` on first run (see `Lab8\Lab8.1\README.md`) |
| Lab8.2 | `SchoolDB` | EF Core `EnsureCreated()` on first run |
| Lab10 | `IdentityUserDB` | EF Core migration: `dotnet ef database update` (see `Lab10\README.md`) |

Note: `Lab9` and `Lab10` each have a single lab question, so the project sits directly in the lab folder (`Lab9\Lab9.csproj`, `Lab10\Lab10.csproj`) instead of a `LabX.Y` sub-folder.
